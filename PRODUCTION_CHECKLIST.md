# HexaBil Production Readiness Checklist

---

# START HERE — What to do (step by step, no confusion)

Do the steps below in order. When you finish, you can say **Production ready**.

---

## PART 1 — Owner: Assign staff to branch and route

1. Log in as **Owner** (e.g. owner1@hexabill.com).
2. Click **Users** in the left menu.
3. Find a **Staff** user. Click the **Edit** (pencil) button for that user.
4. In the popup, click the **Assignments** tab.
5. Tick **one or more Branch** and **one or more Route**. Click **Save**.
6. Click **Branches & Routes** in the left menu. Click **one branch** (e.g. vatanappally).
7. On the branch page, click the **Staff** tab. You should see the staff you assigned, with route names. You can click **Assign staff** to add more or **Remove** to remove.
8. Go back to **Users**. In the table, the **Assigned (Branch / Route)** column should show branch and route names for that staff.

---

## PART 2 — Staff: Check POS, Ledger, Expenses

9. Log **out**. Log in as the **Staff** user you assigned in Part 1.
10. Click **POS**. You must **not** see "No branches or routes assigned". You should see branch/route or dropdowns.
11. Click **Customer Ledger**. Select branch and route in the filter. You should see customers; no "No branches or routes assigned".
12. Click **Expenses**. You should see **Add Expense**. You must **not** see **New Category** (only Owner sees that).

---

## PART 3 — Reports (Branch and Route, COGS)

13. Log in as **Owner** again. Click **Reports**.
14. Click the **Branch** tab. Table must show Sales, COGS, Expenses, Profit. You can expand a row to see routes.
15. Click the **Route** tab. List of all routes with Sales, COGS, Expenses, Profit.
16. **COGS** = product cost. So: in **Purchases**, add a purchase and fill **cost** for items. Then Branch and Route reports will show real COGS and profit. If you never enter cost in purchases, COGS will stay 0.

---

## PART 4 — Full app test (every page, every role)

17. As **Owner**: Open every item in the left menu (Dashboard, Products, Pricelist, Purchases, POS, Customer Ledger, Sales Ledger, Expenses, Reports, Branches, Routes, Users, Settings, Backup, Import, Profile, Subscription, Updates, Help, Feedback). Open every tab inside Reports. Each page must **load** (no blank screen). Press **F12** → Console tab: there must be **no red errors**.
18. As **Staff**: Log in as Staff. Open every page they can see. Same: each loads, no red errors in F12.
19. As **Super Admin**: Log in at the Super Admin login page. Open Dashboard, Tenants, one tenant detail, Impersonate, then other Super Admin pages. Same: each loads, no red errors.

---

## Error handling and production readiness

- **Error matrix:** See `docs/ERROR_MATRIX.md` for how each HTTP status (400, 401, 403, 404, 500, 502, 503) is mapped to user messages and retry.
- **Risk factors:** Same email across tenants is allowed (user choice); enforce strong password and rate limiting. SQLite is not for production scale; use PostgreSQL in production. Unhandled 500s are persisted to ErrorLogs (Super Admin can view).

---

## Your 4 questions (one-line answers)

- **How much errors?** → **Zero** red errors in F12 when you use the app. You check this in Part 4.
- **How many clients same time without errors?** → App does not set a number. Usually **10–50** users on one server is OK. Test with 2–3 browser tabs or 2–3 people.
- **Loading all OK?** → **Yes.** Every page must show loading then content. You check this in Part 4.
- **One always same? (consistent)?** → **Yes.** One login = one user. Staff always see only their branches/routes. Same COGS logic everywhere.

---

## When can you say Production ready?

When you have done **Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4** and you see **no wrong calculations**, **no mixed data between tenants**, and **no red errors in the console** → then you can say **Production ready**. You can also tick the detailed checklist below and sign at the end.

---

## WHAT TO DO — Simple steps (short version)

Do these in order so you know the app works end-to-end.

### A. Owner flow (assign staff to branches/routes)

1. **Log in as Owner.**
2. Go to **Users** (sidebar).
3. Click **Edit** (pencil) on a Staff user (e.g. Anandu).
4. Open the **Assignments** tab. Tick at least one **Branch** and one **Route**. Click **Save**.
5. Go to **Branches & Routes** → click a branch (e.g. vatanappally).
6. Open the **Staff** tab. You should see that staff listed with their route names. Use **Assign staff** to add more, or **Remove** to unassign.
7. In **Users**, the table column **Assigned (Branch / Route)** should show branch and route names for that staff.

### B. Staff flow (after you assigned them)

1. **Log out.** Log in as **Staff** (the user you assigned in A).
2. Open **POS**. You should see branch/route (or dropdowns). You should **not** see “No branches or routes assigned” if you assigned them in A.
3. Open **Customer Ledger**. Choose branch and route in the filter; you should see only customers for that branch/route. No “No branches or routes assigned” if assigned.
4. Open **Expenses**. You should see “Add Expense” but **no** “New Category” (only Owner has that). Totals are for your assigned branch(es).

### C. Reports (COGS and profit)

1. Log in as **Owner**. Go to **Reports**.
2. Open **Branch** tab: table has Sales, COGS, Expenses, Profit. Expand a branch to see routes.
3. Open **Route** tab: flat list of all routes with Sales, COGS, Expenses, Profit.
4. **COGS comes from product cost.** So: go to **Purchases**, add a purchase with **cost** for products. Then Branch/Route reports will show real COGS and profit. If you never enter purchase cost, COGS stays 0.

### D. Full app test (then say Production ready)

1. **Owner:** Open **every** page in the sidebar (Dashboard, Products, Pricelist, Purchases, POS, Customer Ledger, Sales Ledger, Expenses, Reports with every tab, Branches, Branch detail tabs, Routes, Route detail, Users, Settings, Backup, Import, Profile, Subscription, Updates, Help, Feedback). Check: page loads, no blank screen, no red errors in browser console (F12).
2. **Staff:** Log in as Staff. Open every page they can see. Same: loads, no errors.
3. **Super Admin:** Log in as Super Admin. Open dashboard, Tenants, tenant detail, Impersonate, then other Super Admin pages. Same: loads, no errors.
4. When **all** of the checklist sections below are ticked → sign **Production ready** at the bottom.

## Your questions — Short answers

| Your question | Answer |
|---------------|--------|
| **How much errors?** | Aim for **zero** red errors in the browser console (F12) when you use the app normally. The checklist asks you to confirm “no errors” after testing. |
| **How many clients can use at same time without errors?** | The app does **not** limit this. It depends on your server. Often **10–50 people** at once is OK for one server. Test with 2–3 users (or 2–3 browser tabs) to be sure; for more users, do a load test on your host. |
| **Loading all OK?** | Yes. Every page should show a **loading** state (spinner) then content. No page should stay blank forever. The checklist has a row for this. |
| **One always same? (consistent)** | Yes. One login = one user; Staff always see only their assigned branches/routes everywhere (POS, Ledger, Expenses). Same COGS logic everywhere (product cost from purchases). So behaviour is consistent. |

---

## BROWSER TEST RUN (AI-executed)

*The AI opened the app in a browser and ran the following. Use this as a partial automated check; you still need to complete the full checklist and Staff/Super Admin flows yourself.*

| Step | What was done | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Started frontend (Vite). Backend may already have been running. | Frontend on port 5174 (5173 was in use). |
| 2 | Opened **Login** (http://localhost:5174/login). | Page loaded; form visible. |
| 3 | Filled email `owner1@hexabill.com`, password `Owner1@123`, clicked **Sign in**. | **OK** — redirected to **Dashboard** (/dashboard). |
| 4 | Navigated to **Users** (/users). | **OK** — page loaded (title: tenant name). |
| 5 | Navigated to **Branches** (/branches). | **OK** — page loaded. |
| 6 | Navigated to **Reports – Branch** (/reports?tab=branch). | **OK** — URL and page loaded. |
| 7 | Navigated to **Reports – Route** (/reports?tab=route). | **OK** — Route report tab loaded. |
| 8 | Navigated to **POS** (/pos). | **OK** — POS page loaded. |

**Summary:** Owner login and key pages (Users, Branches, Reports Branch/Route, POS) **load without navigation errors**. Console/network were not fully inspected in this run. **You should:** (1) Manually do Owner flow A (Edit user → Assignments, Branch → Staff tab), (2) Log in as Staff and verify POS/Ledger/Expenses, (3) Open F12 and confirm no red errors on each page, (4) Run Super Admin login and pages. Then tick the checklist and sign **Production ready** below.

## 1. Concurrency & Load (No Errors Under Normal Use)

| # | Check | Done |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1.1 | **Concurrent users**: App has no hardcoded “max users” limit. Capacity depends on your server (CPU, RAM) and database (e.g. PostgreSQL max connections). | ☐ |
| 1.2 | **Typical range**: Single backend instance often handles **10–50 concurrent browser users** without errors if server is sized correctly. | ☐ |
| 1.3 | **Same user, multiple tabs**: One user with 2–3 tabs (e.g. POS + Reports) should work without errors or data mix-up. | ☐ |
| 1.4 | **Session**: One login = one session; no shared session between users (tenant + user isolation). | ☐ |

**Note:** For “how many clients at same time without errors,” run load tests (e.g. 5–10 users at once) on your staging/host; adjust server/DB if you need more.

---

## 2. Loading & Errors (App-Wide)

| # | Check | Done |
|---|--------|-----|
| 2.1 | Every page shows a **loading state** (spinner/skeleton) while data is fetched—no permanent blank screen. | ☐ |
| 2.2 | **Browser console**: No red errors or unhandled promise rejections during normal flows (login, navigate, save). | ☐ |
| 2.3 | **Network**: API calls return 2xx for success; 4xx/5xx show a user-friendly message (toast or inline), not a crash. | ☐ |
| 2.4 | **Offline / server down**: Connection status or error message is shown; app doesn’t hang forever. | ☐ |
